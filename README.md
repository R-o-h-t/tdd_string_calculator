# String Calculator TDD Project

This project implements the "String Calculator" kata from the TDD Manifesto (https://tddmanifesto.com/exercises/), following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. The goal is to create a simple string calculator that can take a string of numbers separated by commas and return their sum.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Dart installed on your system. If Dart is not installed, follow the instructions on the Dart [official website](https://dart.dev/get-dart) to install it.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/string_calculator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd string_calculator
   ```

3. **Get dependencies:**

   Run the following command to fetch the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   dart pub get
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
dart run
```

### Running Tests

This project follows the TDD approach, so tests are a crucial part. To run the tests, execute:
